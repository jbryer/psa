# Introduction

The use of propensity score methods [@RosenbaumRubin1983] for estimating causal effects in observational studies or certain kinds of quasi-experiments has been increasing in the social sciences [@ThoemmesKim2011] and in medical research [@Austin2008a] in the last decade. Propensity score analysis (PSA) attempts to adjust selection bias that occurs due to the lack of randomization. Analysis is typically conducted in two phases where in phase I, the probability of placement in the treatment is estimated to identify matched pairs or clusters so that in phase II, comparisons on the dependent variable can be made between matched pairs or within clusters. R [@R-base] is ideal for conducting PSA given its wide availability of the most current statistical methods vis-à-vis add-on packages as well as its superior graphics capabilities.

This book will provide a theoretical overview of propensity score methods as well as illustrations and discussion of PSA applications. Methods used in phase I of PSA (i.e. models or methods for estimating propensity scores) include logistic regression, classification trees, and matching. Discussions on appropriate comparisons and estimations of effect size and confidence intervals in phase II will also be covered. The use of graphics for diagnosing covariate balance as well as summarizing overall results will be emphasized. Lastly, the extension of PSA methods for multilevel data will also be presented.

## Counterfactual Model for Causality

In order to understand how propensity score analysis allows us to make causal estimates from observational data, we must first understand the basic principals of causality, particulary the counterfactual model. Figure \@ref(fig:introduction-causality) depicts a conterfactual model. We begin with our research subject. This can be a student, patient, rat, asteroid, or any other object we wish to know whether some condition has an effect on. Consider two parallel universes: one where the subject receives condition A and another where they receive condition B. Typically one condition is some treatment whereas the other condition is the absense of that treatment (also referred to as the control). We will use treatment and control throughout this book to refer to these two conditions. Once the individual has been exposed to the two conditions, the outcome is measured. The difference between these outcomes is the true causal effect. However, it is impossible for an object to exist in two universes at the same time, therefore we can never actually observe the true causal effect. @Holland1986 referred to this as the *Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference*.

## Randomized Control Trials "The Gold Standard"

The randomized experiment has been the goals standard for estimating causal effects. Effects can be estimated using simple means between groups, or blocks in randomized block design. Randomization presumes unbiasedness and balance between groups. However, randomization is often not feasible for many reasons, especially in educational contexts.

The strong ignorability assumtion states that an outcome is independent of any observed or unobserved covariates under randomization. This is represented mathematically as:

$$\left( { Y }_{ i }\left( 1 \right) ,{ Y }_{ i }\left( 0 \right)  \right) \bot { T }_{ i }$$

For all ${X}_{i}$

Therefore, it follows that the causal effect of a treatment is the difference in an individual’s outcome under the situation they were given the treatment and not (referred to as a counterfactual).

$${\delta}_{i} = { Y }_{ i1 }-{ Y }_{ i0 }$$

However, it is impossible to directly observe \\({\delta}_{i}\\) (referred to as The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference, Holland 1986). Rubin framed this problem as a missing data problem.

#### Estimate Propensity Scores

The goal in phase one of PSA is to estimate the probability of being in the treatment. Since in most cases this is a binary outcome, logistic regressionis a common approach to estimating propensity scores. 

$$ \sigma =\frac { { e }^{ t } }{ { e }^{ t }+1 } =\frac { 1 }{ 1+{ e }^{ -1 } }  $$

$$ t={ \beta  }+{ \beta  }_{ 1 }x+\cdots +{ \beta  }_{ k } $$

$$ F\left( x \right) =\frac { 1 }{ 1+{ e }^{ -\left( { \beta  }+{ \beta  }_{ 1 }x+\cdots +{ \beta  }_{ k } \right)  } } $$

## R Primer

R is a statistical software language designed to be extended vis-à-vis packages. As of `r format(Sys.Date(), format = '%B %d, %Y')`, there are currently `r format(nrow(available.packages(contrib.url('https://cran.r-project.org'))), big.mark = ',')` packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). Given the ease by which R can be extended, it has become the tool of choice for conducting propensity score analysis. This book will make use of a number of packages matching, multiple imputation of missing values, and to visualize results.

## Datasets

### National Supported Work Demonstration {#lalonde}

The `lalonde` dataset is perhaps one of the most used datasets when introducing or evaluating propensity score methods. The data was collected by @Lalonde1986 but became widely used in the PSA literature after @DehejiaWahba1999 used it in their paper to evaluate propensity score matching. The dataset originated from the National Supported Work Demonstration study conducted in the 1970s. The program provided 12 to 18 months of employment to people with longstanding employment problems. The dataset contains `r nrow(lalonde)` observations of `r ncol(lalonde)` variables. The primary outcome is `re78` which is real earnings in 1978. Observed covariates used to ajdust for selection bias include `age` (age in years), `edu` (number of years of education), `black` (black or not), `hisp` (Hispanic or not), `married` (married or not), `nodegr` (whether the worker has a degree or not, note that 1 = no degree), `re74` (real earnings in 1974), and `re75` (real earnings in 1975).

```{r introduction-lalonde, eval=TRUE}
data(lalonde, package='Matching')
str(lalonde)
```

### Lindner Center {#lindner}

Data from an observational study of 996 patients receiving a PCI at Ohio Heart Health in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the Lindner Center. This is a landmark dataset in the literature on propensity score adjustment for treatment selection bias due to practice of evidence based medicine; patients receiving `abciximab` tended to be more severely diseased than those who did not receive a IIb/IIIa cascade blocker.

```{r introduction-lindner, eval=TRUE}
data(lindner, package='PSAgraphics')
str(lindner)
```

### Tutoring {#tutoring}

The `tutoring` dataset originates from a study conducted at an online adult serving institution examining the effects of tutoring services for students in English 101, English 201, and History 310. Tutoring services were available to all students but Treatment (`treat`) is operationalized as students who used tutoring services at least once during the course. Only `r round(100 - sum(tutoring$treat == 'Control') / nrow(tutoring) * 100, digits = 1)`% of students used tutoring services with approximately half using it more than once. We will use this dataset with both a dichotomous treatment (used tutoring or not) or as a two level treatment (used tutoring services once, used tutoring services two or more times).

```{r introduction-tutoring, eval=TRUE}
data(tutoring, package='TriMatch')
tutoring$treat2 <- tutoring$treat != 'Control'
str(tutoring)
table(tutoring$Course, tutoring$treat)
```

### Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA) {#pisa}

```{r introduction-pisa, eval=TRUE}
data(pisana, package='multilevelPSA')
str(pisana)
```

### National Medical Expenditure Study {#nmes}

```{r introduction-nmes, eval=TRUE}
data(nmes, package='TriMatch')
str(nmes)
```
