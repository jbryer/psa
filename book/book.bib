	easy to use and can effectively reduce the bias caused by nonrandom

	in practice, the propensity score methods are generally confined to
	binary treatment scenarios. Two possible exceptions have been suggested
	for ordinal and categorical treatments. In this article we develop
	theory and methods that encompass all of these techniques and widen
	their applicability by allowing for arbitrary treatment regimes.
	We illustrate our propensity function methods by applying them to
	two datasets; we estimate the effect of smoking on medical expenditure
	and the effect of schooling on wages. We also conduct simulation
	studies to investigate the performance of our methods.},

@electronic{Zhaoetal2012,
	Abstract = {Propensity score methods have become a part of the standard toolkit
	for applied researchers who wish to ascertain causal effects from
	observational data. While they were originally developed for binary
	treatments, several researchers have proposed generalizations of
	the propensity score methodology for non-binary treatment regimes.
	Such extensions have widened the applicability of propensity score
	methods and are indeed becoming increasingly popular themselves.
	In this article, we closely examine the two main generalizations
	of propensity score methods, namely, the generalized propensity score
	(gps) of Hirano and Imbens (2004) and the propensity function (p-function)
	of Imai and van Dyk (2004). We compare the assumptions, theoretical
	properties, and empirical performance of these two alternative methodologies.
	On a theoretical level, the gps is advantageous in that it can be
	used to estimate the full dose response function rather than the
	simple average treatment effect that is typically estimated with
	the p-function. Unfortunately, our analysis shows that in practice
	the response model used with the GPS is less exible than those typically
	used with propensity score methods and is prone to misspecification.
	We propose methods to improve the robustness of the gps to potential
	model misspecification and the exibility of the p-function in estimating
	the dose response function. We illustrate our findings and proposals
	through simulation studies, including one based on an empirical application.},
