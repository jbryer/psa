# Preface {-}

I first encountered propensity score analysis (PSA) by my late dissertation advisor Robert Pruzek in 2006 when I entered graduate school. The notion that you could get reasonable causal estimates without the need of randomization was foreign to me and at first, I was skeptical. Many years later having used PSA for many projects, not only am I convinced it is possible, I believe there are instances where this may be preferred over the randomized control trial. I have been the Principal Investigator for two Federal grants to develop and test the [Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS)](https://daacs.net) where have attempted to conduct large scale randomized control trials (RCT) involving thousands of students. Through those experiences I have found that there are numerous compromises made in delivering an intervention that the generalizability of the results to a context where we are not concerned about the RCT make interpretations difficult. Moreover, RCTs assume a single effect for everyone. With PSA, particularly in the stratification section, it is possible to tease out how an intervention may vary by the observed covariates.

I have taught PSA many times over the years. This "book" is my attempt to collect my notes and experiences on conducting PSA. For the most part I will emphasize the applied and provide links to references if the reader wishes to explore the theoretical in more details. The `psa` R package that accompanies this book is available on Github and can be installed using the `remotes` package with the command below. By setting the `dependencies = TRUE` parameter will ensure that all the R packages used in this book are installed as well. The `psa` package contains a number of datasets and utility functions used throughout the book. But it also contains a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application designed to conduct PSA using a graphical user interface. Details on using the application are provided in the [appendix](#psa_shiny).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install(build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = 'Enhances')
